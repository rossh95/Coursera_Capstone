A 2019 report by Deloitte called on the European Health & Fitness Market (https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/es/Documents/acerca-de-deloitte/Deloitte-ES-TMT-European-Health-Fitness-Market-2019.pdf) showed that there were 62.2 million members of fitness clubs, an increase in memberships of 3.5% that year, resulting in a 1.2% growth in the market and a total revenue of EUR 27.2 billion in 2018.

It is becoming more and more common to see gyms/fitness studios opening around the country but they tend to be large companies such as Puregym who are currently leading the UK fitness market with 1.01 million members. I live in Glasgow, Scotland in a fairly upcoming and trendy area/neighborhood known for its restaurants and parks etc. making it a popular spot for students and young professionals to live in, but I have noticed that my nearest gym/fitness club is around a 30 minute walk away in a different area. The larger companies like Puregym tend to open in city centres and retail parks due to the space available in units and the large concentrations of people in those areas so it is unlikely that they will open in areas like mine just out of the city centre areas. This made me realise that there might be an opportunity for independent gyms and fitness clubs to open in areas like mine, maybe not quite to the scale of the market leading companies but can draw in members due to the location."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In particular I believe this might interest anyone looking to start a new business such as personal trainers looking for their own space as well as current business owners that might own their own independent gym/fitness club(s) that are looking to expand and grow their business. However it is also possible that it may help larger companies identify suitable areas for a new store by doing an analysis of the whole city."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
